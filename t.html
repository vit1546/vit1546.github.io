Thanks for reaching out! My name is {{ticket.assignee.first_name}}, and I am happy to assist you today.

Unfortunately, no such option is currently available. Every time you save a document, Grammarly needs to re-scan it to check whether any of the paragraphs have changed. This is required because Microsoft Office and other add-ins you may have installed can access and change your document between the start and completion of the saving procedure. Because there is no way for us to control or detect any of these changes, we need to take a look at the whole document again to be sure it hasn't changed.

Breaking your document up into several smaller ones and checking them one by one might help you save time.

I hope this explanation makes sense, but please let us know if we can assist you further.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly. 

Unfortunately, Norton AntiVirus falsely flags the Grammarly installer as harmful or untrustworthy. To lift the flag, we are required to register each new version with Symantec. We do not currently do that because we don't think it's a fair way to vet the safety of software. Please disregard the threat warning and proceed with the installation. To give yourself peace of mind, you can submit the GrammarlyAddInSetup.exe file to https://www.virustotal.com/ for online analysis, where you should see that Norton AntiVirus is the only one that flags our program as harmful.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention! I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue.

I know that it's definitely not an ideal workaround, but breaking your XXX-page document into 50-page sections, naming each section to keep them in order (e.g., part 01, part 02, etc.) and working on each document one by one should resolve this issue. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as our engineers work on fixing this issue in the future.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

Thank you for your message.

To help our engineers troubleshoot this for you, please provide us with the Word/Outlook crash dump files by following these instructions:

Install Automated Dump Collection Utility

1. Download the grammarly_crashdump_tools.zip file attached to this message.
2. Extract it to the C:\grammarly_crashdump_tools folder.
3. Double-click to run install_crashdump.reg and click Yes in each prompt window that opens.


Use Automated Dump Collection Utility

When you run Word or Outlook after installing the utility, a black console window will appear. Please don't close it — it will close automatically after the Outlook or Word window closes. It monitors Outlook and Word for crashes and saves crash dumps to the C:\grammarly_crashdump_tools\CrashDumps folder.

After Word or Outlook crashes, the pop-up "Windows is checking for a solution to the problem" will appear. It is important that you don't click Cancel to close the pop-up. Wait until the Close program button appears and click on it.

Note:
Saving crash dump files may take several minutes, so you'll need to be patient.


Sending Crash Dump Files

Send the three crash dump files from the C:\grammarly_crashdump_tools\CrashDumps folder to Grammarly support along with the version of the Office Add-in you use. (If you used the utility more than once, make sure to send us the latest three files.)

To check the version of your Grammarly add-in for Microsoft Office, please click on the Grammarly tab in the Word panel, then click About.

Because the crash dump files are big (more than 600Mb), you will need to share them via cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)

Google Drive:
https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2424368?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop
https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop

OneDrive:
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upload-photos-and-files-to-OneDrive-b00ad3fe-6643-4b16-9212-de00ef02b586
https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Share-OneDrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07

Dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/help/4455
https://www.dropbox.com/help/274

Once you have uploaded the files to cloud storage, please remove C:\grammarly_crashdump_tools\CrashDumps before each run of Outlook and Word because it takes a lot of disk space.



Uninstall Automated Dump Collection Utility

1. Double-click to run uninstall_crashdump.reg and click Yes in each prompt window that opens.
2. Remove the C:\grammarly_crashdump_tools folder.

Thank you for contacting Grammarly Support! I'm happy to answer this for you.

Grammarly strives to provide smooth and flawless user experience. For this reason, our company opted out of supporting older OS (like Windows XP and Windows Vista) that might hinder our service's functionality, thus impacting our users' impression from our service.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please note that you are most welcome to upgrade your OS to continue using our service. You can take advantage of Grammarly if you have Windows 7, Windows 8,  Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on your computer.

Thank you for understanding. Please feel free to contact us with any additional questions or comments.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly. I'm happy to answer this for you!

Grammarly views a paragraph as the minimal unit of your text. Every time you make a change in the document, the whole paragraph where the change occurred needs to be re-checked. You can try splitting your document into smaller paragraphs and see if that helps.

Checking time can also be affected by the number of paragraphs in your document. Every time you save a document, Grammarly needs to re-scan it to check if any of the paragraphs have changed. This is required because Microsoft Office and other add-ins you may have installed can access and change your document in-between the start and completion of the saving procedure. Because there is no way for us to control and/or detect any of these changes, we need to take a look at the whole document again to be sure it hasn't changed.

I hope this explanation makes sense. Please let us know if we can assist you further.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! I'm truly sorry to learn that you experienced this issue. 

We suggest that you try following these steps to resolve it:

1. Split your document into smaller parts if it is larger than ~ 50 pages
2. Try working on just one document at a time
3. Try disabling other add-ins as they sometimes can interfere with Grammarly
4. Disable your antivirus software

If there's anything else we can do for you, please let us know.

Thank you for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to check this for you.

I see that you filed a chargeback with your bank, which resulted in deactivation of your Premium subscription as per our Terms of Service and License Agreement (https://grammarly.com/terms). Please see an excerpt from the Agreement below:

"Grammarly may deny you access to all or any part of the Services or terminate your account with or without prior notice if you engage in any conduct or activities that Grammarly determines, in its sole discretion, violate this Agreement or the rights of Grammarly or any third party, or is otherwise inappropriate."

As your chargeback was disputed, your payment was not refunded by your bank. 

However, we highly value every Grammarly customer, so we will refund your payment as a gesture of goodwill. Please look for the refund to appear on your credit card statement within the next 10 business days, depending on your bank.

If there's anything else we can do for you, please let us know.

In most cases when a card gets cancelled, your account information will remain the same. The credit card issuer simply links both the old card number and your new one to the account, so any refunds to the canceled card will still be credited to the right place.

Annual subscriptions are billed as one annual payment and can’t be split into smaller installments. If you would prefer to pay monthly, we do offer a monthly subscription. However, with a monthly plan you’ll miss out on the overall savings offered by the annual plan. The current rates (grammarly.com/premium) are as follows:

Annual Subscription — $139.95/one year*

According to PayPal, the buyer is able to use their balance when making a purchase using PayPal. The PayPal balance is always the default Payment method when making a payment. Even though the balance is used, an alternate payment method must be on file for the billing agreement to process.

If you don’t have a credit card to provide, you’ll need to reach out to PayPal to see if they can change these settings for you. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do from our end about this. Many apologies for the inconvenience.

Thank you for contacting Grammarly. My name is {{ticket.assignee.name}}, and I’m happy to assist you with this!

We apologize for any confusion that the recent charge you contacted us about has caused. Here is an explanation of why you were charged:

Grammarly uses a third-party PCI-compliant credit card processor to handle payment processing and keep billing information up to date. 

If you are seeing charges on a new card that you haven't added to your Grammarly account, your financial institution has automatically updated this information for us to attempt the transaction. Financial institutions do this to ensure that accounts using recurring payments remain in good standing when a new card is issued. In some cases, your financial institution may also allow recurring charges to continue on an expired card. Such programs are the Visa® Account Updater and MasterCard® Automatic Billing Updater programs. American Express® has a recurring billing program similar to the Visa Account Updater and MasterCard Automatic Billing Updater programs. This program requires no action on our part.

If you have any concerns about this process and would like to verify your issuing bank's participation in the programs, please contact your credit card company.

I hope this clarifies the matter for you. And we once again apologize for any confusion.

Thanks for writing in today. I'm happy to answer this for you!

Grammarly's browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge integrates contextual spelling and grammar check, thesaurus, and dictionary directly into your favorite websites.

Grammarly's browser extension will help you find and fix contextual spelling mistakes, such as the use of there-their-they’re, allowed-aloud, two-too and many others. Grammarly  will also detect some basic grammar mistakes, such as punctuation, article use, capitalization and word misuses. 

You can learn more about the extension in the article below:

Hope this helps!

Thank you for contacting Grammarly Customer Support!

Our technical team is aware of the problem you reported, but unfortunately, we don’t currently have a quick fix. I can’t provide you with an estimated timeframe right now because the developers need some time to analyze the cause of the issue, but please rest assured that we won’t forget about it.

As a workaround, we suggest that you use Grammarly on Zoho in plain text mode. To switch to plain text mode, click "Plain text" in the right corner of the compose window. This will set your Zoho to plain text mode by default and all emails will be composed in plain text until you choose to switch back to rich text mode. 

If you have any other questions, just let me know and I’ll be happy to help. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Grammarly will help you find and fix contextual spelling mistakes, such as the use of there-their-they’re, allowed-aloud, two-too and many others. It will also detect some basic grammar mistakes, such as punctuation, article use, capitalization and word misuses. 

I hope this helps, but please feel free to contact me with any further questions or comments.

Thanks for reaching out!

If you sent an invitation email, but your team member cannot find it after checking their spam folder, suggest adding info@em.grammarly.com to their contact list. Afterward, we recommend sending the invitation email again.

If this doesn't help, it must be your team member's firewall/email server or filter that is blocking Grammarly's emails. Please instruct your team member to contact their email service provider's Customer Support to whitelist the following IPs and email address to ensure that all Grammarly emails get through:

IPs:
199.122.124.187 
13.111.6.89 

Emails: 
info@em.grammarly.com
info@send.grammarly.com
donotreply@grammarly.com

Once your team member follows these steps, please resend the invitation. 

I hope this helps, but please let us know if you require any further assistance.

Thanks for reaching out! I'm happy to look into this for you.

Would you mind specifying what tool you are using when the issue occurs? Is that the browser extension (for Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge), the Microsoft Office add-in, the Grammarly Editor (app.grammarly.com), the desktop app for PC and Mac, or the Grammarly Keyboard for mobile?

The test results show that your network configuration prevents the Grammarly services from working on your computer.

If the WebSockets test failed and the other tests returned "success" results, please reach out to your ISP or network administrator to make sure that:

The IP addresses mapped to these domains are allowed by your firewall/proxy: 
- capi.grammarly.com
- dox.grammarly.com

We also suggest you temporarily disable your proxy, antivirus software, and firewall to see if that helps resolve the issue.

If that doesn't work for you, please try to login to Grammarly from another location (office, home, Internet café, or using a 3G/4G modem), where the Internet Provider is different.

Grammarly Insights reports are available on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, at this time, it's not possible to access all reports at once directly from your account. 

However, you can view your old reports if you run a search for “Grammarly Insights” in your mailbox.

I hope this workaround helps, but please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. And have a great day!

Thanks for contacting Grammarly Support! 

Grammarly is cloud-based software and cannot be used offline. You need a stable Internet connection in order to access the powerful algorithms that Grammarly uses to analyze your text. These algorithms can't be stored on any single device—it’s simply too much data—but this approach is what allows Grammarly to offer writing checks that are far superior to those of computer-based word processors.

I hope this answers your question, but please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you might have.

Kindly,

Unfortunately, Grammarly doesn't support integration with Waterfox at this time, but thank you for letting us know that it’s something you’d like to see. I’ve forwarded your request to our product team so that they can take it into account when making development plans.

The good news is that you can install the Grammarly extension for Firefox at 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grammarly-1/

Once you have downloaded and installed the Grammarly extension for Firefox, you should be able to use it as you write online. Simply click on the "G" button in the bottom right-hand corner of a text field, and Grammarly will show mistakes in the Editor window that opens automatically. Also, you can hover over a highlighted mistake and apply a correction suggested by Grammarly on the card that will appear.

I hope this helps! Should you have any further questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! 

Since Grammarly is a self-teaching automated service, all our suggestions are generated based on algorithms. Our service suggests corrections for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and writing style. This process does not involve human proofreaders; it’s based on the sophisticated algorithms that power our products. Please note that we do not claim that our service is 100% accurate because there are limitations to what a program can do (versus what a highly trained English or writing expert can do).
 
However, we do offer human proofreading services to Premium for an additional price. If you use our professional proofreading services, our proofreaders will review your document and correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. However, editing is confined to clear errors; our professionals do not rewrite or reorganize your paper to make it more accurate or convincing, and they attempt to keep the original meaning of the sentence and document fully intact.

I hope this clarifies the matter! Please feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns you may have.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly. You’ve asked a great question!

Each style of writing that you can choose from is associated with a specific set of spelling and grammar checks that enable the Grammarly Editor to most accurately review your work. It’s a good thing! 

Please select the style that best corresponds to the type of writing you are checking. “General” is a good one to start with if you are unsure which style to pick.

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you might have.

Sincerely,

{{ticket.assignee.name}}</td><td>information, information_features_styles</td></tr><tr><td>Information::Features::About Genres or Domain (Detailed)</td><td>Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to answer this for you.

Grammarly’s main focus is on spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Hence, these checks are present in almost all genres and document types. The main distinctions among Grammarly genres are stylistic.

Please select the style that best corresponds to the type of writing you are checking. “General” is a good one to start with if you are unsure which style to pick.

General
This genre is our default. It suggests changes to make your writing polite and professional, but not overly formal. It should be used when the type of writing does not fall under any group described below. General includes almost all our checks, except for the checks that are best suited to very formal writing: the who-vs-whom dilemma, conjunctions at the beginning of the sentence (e.g., starting a sentence with And), and some others. This setting also won’t flag any colloquialisms (a lot of, a great amount of) or contractions (wasn’t, can’t).

The genres below are ordered from most to least formal:

Academic
This genre is technically the strictest among Grammarly genres. It's suitable for essays, theses, dissertations, and legal documents. On top of finding grammar and punctuation mistakes, it detects usage of passive voice and contractions (I’m, don’t), first- and second-person pronouns (I, you), and mistakes with who and whom; it also locates cases that should use the subjunctive mood and takes care of casual punctuation (changes !!! to ! and puts periods in some abbreviations).

Business
The business genre was developed for business communication (emails, presentations). It also checks the text against formal writing criteria. However, it allows the use of some informal expressions, first- and second-person pronouns, numerals instead of spelled-out numbers, and some colloquialisms (e.g., in spite of).

Medical and Technical
These two settings work similarly in terms of checks allowed or restricted. Since these genres are used in technical and scientific writing (manuals, instructions, research results, etc.), the checks here are aimed at removing ambiguities. The genres detect subjunctive mood and expressions like etc. and and/or. The settings also allow the usage of numerals. Also, the Technical setting flags any future tense usage.

Casual
The Casual genre is designed for personal communication (chatting, informal emails). It ignores most style issues. It doesn’t flag contractions, double negatives, passive voice, subjective pronouns, or split infinitives (to really like).

Creative
The Creative genre is similar to Casual. It is the least strict genre, so it’s suitable for writing novels or short stories. Like all other genres, it catches grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes. However, it provides a more creative setting for those who are experts in the English grammar and want to bend the rules in order to use a stylistic device or narrative technique. The Creative genre doesn’t detect sentence fragments (missing subject or verb), wordy sentences, colloquialisms, slang (wanna, gotta), squinting modifiers, or incomplete comparisons.

Thanks for your question. I'm happy to answer it for you!

We teamed up with ProQuest to provide even more accurate plagiarism checks: from now on, Grammarly’s plagiarism checker searches major proprietary databases along with over 16 billion web pages. We mark any text that matches text published on the Internet as potential plagiarism and suggest citation data to create a reference in accordance with three different formats: APA, MLA, and The Chicago Manual of Style.

Please note that the plagiarism checker option is available to Premium users only.

Thanks for contacting us here today. That’s a great question!

As a Premium user, you have access to both critical and advanced issues. We use different colors to highlight the potential mistakes in your text. The alerts with the red underlining are critical. The errors underlined in yellow are advanced. 

Critical issues are the ones essential for credibility and correctness, while advanced ones help you polish up an important document or a letter.

To name a few examples, advanced checks include vocabulary enhancements, stylistic issues, sentence structure, and advanced grammar issues. Critical issues are the most basic errors, such as missing articles.

I hope this answers your question, but please give me a shout if you have any other questions!

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! My name is {{ticket.assignee.name}} and I’m happy to answer your questions. 

Microsoft Word’s spell-check feature does not identify the following writing errors, which Grammarly does:

Contextual spelling: E.g., using effect vs. affect, principal vs. principle, compliment vs. complement. These words may sound the same, but the right one to use depends on context.

Punctuation: E.g., a missing comma after “thing” in: “I never miss a thing” says spell-check.

Prepositions: Non-native English speakers are especially prone to preposition mistakes, such as writing “you’re mixing me” instead of “you’re mixing me up.” Or “the man is out the house” instead of “the man is out of the house” (or “outside the house” – yet another meaning).

Quantifiers: Pairing the wrong type of quantifier with a noun is a very common mistake. For example, you can have less rain or fewer storms, but you can’t have fewer rain or less storms.

Modifiers: Squinting, dangling, or misplaced modifiers confuse readers, yet spell-check does not correct them. For example: “After writing a brilliant essay, spell-check did not catch my mistake.” Spell-check didn’t write your essay, did it? But your modifying phrase suggests otherwise!

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any additional questions or concerns you might have.

In the meantime, I suggest that you disable Grammarly manually when needed.

To disable the Grammarly extension for certain websites, please click the green G icon on your browser's toolbar and disable "Check for Grammar and Spelling."

Please keep in touch and let us know how we can assist you further.

Thanks for writing in today! I'm happy to assist you with this.

Please note that Grammarly is not capable of checking the formatting of your entire document. In order to review your work, the Grammarly Editor converts your document into plain text formatting, which is why the footnotes in any document uploaded into the Grammarly Editor are visualized as regular text. 

The good news is that your exported (downloaded) document should contain footnotes. When you are finished, simply download your edited piece using the Download button. The original formatting of your document will be preserved in its downloaded/exported version.

I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to answer this for you.

Grammarly – when you copy and paste into it – converts your document to plain text. All the formatting in your original document will be lost.

To preserve the formatting of your text while using the Grammarly Editor, use the Upload (Import) and Download (Export) buttons to check documents that have been written in other text editors like MS Word, TextEdit, or OpenOffice.

Once you're finished editing your text, click the Download or Export button to download the edited text to your computer. Open the new document and you’ll find your original text formatting intact. 

Supported file types are MS Word (.doc, .docx), OpenOffice (.odt), .txt and .rtf.

This method is also true for Grammarly's native desktop app for Macs or PCs: www.grammarly.com/native 

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you might have.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to answer your questions. 

Your Performance score tells you how accurate your document is compared to documents written by other Grammarly users who set the same goals you did.

For example, imagine you open a document in the Grammarly Editor and choose the goals "Tell a Story" and "Informal." Grammarly calculates the accuracy level of your document based on the total word count and the number and types of writing issues detected. Then, Grammarly compares the accuracy level of your document to the accuracy levels of all other documents where users chose the goals "Tell a Story" and "Informal." The Performance score you see tells you how your document compares to these other documents. A score of 90, for example, means that the writing in your document is more accurate than the writing in 90 percent of other documents with similar goals.

Please note that the score provided by Grammarly is generated for your consideration only; it should not be used to determine an official academic grade or other benchmark that necessitates human input.

Additionally, all product users will receive a weekly email with personal stats, insights, tips, and rankings. Some users enjoy these features as a way to self-monitor progress, or see where they want the most improvement. 

Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you might have.

Thank you for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to assist you today.

When we show synonyms for words, we are relying on the data collected in Webster’s New World Roget’s A-Z Thesaurus. If Grammarly does not show a synonym for a particular word, it means that the thesaurus we are using doesn't provide synonyms for this word. We do update our thesaurus from time to time, so I will pass your request to the development team. 

I hope this clarifies the matter, but please let me know if I can assist you further.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly Customer Support! I'm happy to answer this for you.

Vocabulary is calculated based on the number of unique words that were checked. For example, if you used the word ‘Beautiful’ five times in a week, then it will count as one unique word. However, all five uses of the word will be counted in the Productivity section. This is why the Productivity number will almost always be higher than the Vocabulary number. (It is possible for you to have a tie if you don’t use any word more than once.)

Please note that in this context, we use the word "unique" in the sense of "different." This metric is intended to help users see how many different words they used as opposed to the total number of words they wrote.

Function words such as 'and' and 'the' are included in the Vocabulary calculation.

Thanks for writing in today! I'm happy to clarify this for you.

Please note that Grammarly does not fully support error correction for texts written in all capital letters at this time. To ensure a proper check of your text, please rewrite the all-caps text in lowercase letters and try it again.

Although Grammarly is not affiliated with this service, you might find this website https://convertcase.net/ useful for lowercasing capitalized words.

Should you have any further questions or comments, please let us know. And have a great day!

Thank you for your question! Let me try to shed some light on why some mistakes haven't been caught in this sentence.

It appears that your text contains symbols that do not constitute the English language characters. At this time, Grammarly can not identify mistakes in a text that contains symbols other than English letters or numbers.

The Grammarly Editor works most effectively when checking naturally written texts that are at least one paragraph long because many of Grammarly’s algorithms work based on context.

I hope this answers your question, but please do not hesitate to reach out any time.

If you choose the Academic, Business, Technical, or Medical document type, Grammarly will suggest changing "who" to "whom." However, using "who" instead of "whom" in an objective position has become very conventional, so "whom" is often considered very formal.

Thank you for writing in today! I'm happy to clarify this for you.

Our writing app thoroughly reviews texts for passive voice constructions. This feature is in demand because the active voice is the preferred style of most readers as the card puts it. The passive voice is a grammatically correct construction, but is frowned upon in many writing styles.

Please note Grammarly does not discourage passive voice. Grammarly notifies you of the frequency of passive constructions in the document. This check serves as a suggestion.

Grammarly checks for the passive voice constructions in all writing styles except for Casual and Creative.

I hope this explanation makes sense, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.

I apologize for the confusion about closing your ticket! The short answer is that we tentatively set tickets on the subject you asked about to “resolved” after we give you all the available information about your question. However, if you have further questions, you can always reopen the ticket by reaching back out to us. Here is a proper explanation of why we close such tickets:

In cases when Grammarly Support cannot directly resolve a technical matter (or a feature request), and we don’t have a timeline from our product team for when the issue will be fixed, we first make sure that our product team logs the issue, and then we notify the customer and tentatively close the ticket. The reason we don’t leave the ticket open is that it may lead customers to believe that we will have more updates for them in the near future, and we don’t want to set false expectations.  

We constantly evaluate the issues and priorities on our log, and I have passed your request along to our product team. You can always reopen this ticket by sending a message to this thread. We are here to help!

I hope this clarifies the matter, and we once again apologize for any confusion.

The Grammarly Keyboard makes sure everything you write is mistake-free.

Should you need to check your text, simply tap the globe icon again and the Grammarly keyboard will appear.

If you'd still like to disable Grammarly for iOS, please follow these steps:

Open Settings on your iOS device

I'll provide a brief example of each topic to help illustrate what we do. <br><br>Spelling includes catching typos or confused words such as "advice" vs. "advise." Grammar includes ensuring that all sentences are grammatically accurate—for example, saying "the staff is happy" instead of "the staff are happy" for certain dialects. Punctuation includes choosing the right marks to add to the appropriate places within the sentence, such as a semicolon vs. a comma. And sentence structure includes ensuring that the internal logic and fluency of each sentence. <br><br>Furthermore, there are several benefits to choosing Human Proofreading. First, when using our service, you'll save time that you'd normally have to spend analyzing all the changes the Grammarly software suggests. Second, your work will be reviewed by our team of experts, who have a great deal of experience working with all sorts of texts, and who have the ability to connect with their colleagues to improve the quality of the document. Third, we're extremely passionate about helping others improve their writing, and we love to bring our enthusiasm for language to our clients. <br><br>Also, it's worth noting that, due to the inherent subjectivity of the English language, every proofreader will approach every document a little differently, but we're always careful to make <i>and </i>review all of our changes to ensure accuracy and proofreading excellence. <br><br>We hope that this added context helps you distinguish between the two services!

Thank you for expressing your concerns. Because of the popularity of our Human Proofreading service, we face a choice about how to deal with periods of extreme demand. While we are working to increase supply by hiring more editors, demand can still outpace supply at times. In those cases, we have to keep the order volume low enough to serve all of the customers who have already submitted their text. Otherwise, we won’t be able to return the corrected documents on time, and the service will be broken.

One way to deal with this issue is to turn off the service – i.e., prevent anyone from ordering Human Proofreading. This can happen on occasion when it becomes impossible for us to complete all orders on time. Another way to balance demand is to increase prices. That way, the service is at least still available for some users. We would rather keep the service running at a higher cost than turn it off altogether, which is why you see price increases. This allows us to serve as many customers as we can while maintaining our standards for quality and punctuality. 

We understand that our approach necessarily limits the availability of our service to some people. Unfortunately, we have no universal remedy to address this problem. Prices follow demand, so if you wait, you are likely to see a decrease. 

We are sorry for the inconvenience, but we hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

For future reference, our goal is simply to ensure that your document is correctly written and grammatically accurate. We thoroughly review each document for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and form. However, some issues identified by Grammarly, such as the use of passive voice or personal pronouns, are a matter of choice for the author. These issues are not necessarily errors; consequently, they may remain unchanged in your final document.

For your reference, Grammarly converts your document to plain text if you copy and paste from another text field, which means all the formatting in your original document will be lost. Any text that is copied and pasted into the Editor before being sent for professional proofreading will be sent as is (i.e., without formatting).

To retain the original formatting of the document, please use the Upload (Import) and Download (Export) buttons to check documents that have been written in other text editors like MS Word, TextEdit, or OpenOffice. This will allow our proofreaders to edit and return your document with the original formatting intact.

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

I am sorry that you are not satisfied with your order. As you requested, I have refunded the document in question. Please look for these funds to appear on your account within 10 business days, depending on your payment method.

Our records show that each order you referenced was completed on or before the deadline we had promised. In the future, please check your spam or junk folders for email regarding your orders, and also check your email filters to ensure that you can receive messages from grammarly.com and proofit.com.

For your reference, our goal is to ensure that your document is grammatically accurate. We diligently review each submission for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and form. However, our proofreaders do not organize, structure, or otherwise rewrite your text. Issues regarding content, style, or voice are at the discretion of the author. If you would like only part of your document to be reviewed, we suggest that you submit only those parts that need to be checked.

I hope this clarifies the issue for you, but do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience.

Thank you for contacting Grammarly! I'm sorry to hear about this.

If you see any documents that you don’t recognize, it is possible that there was unauthorized access.

OR

If you’re prompted to verify an account change, it’s possible that there was unauthorized access.

To prevent unauthorized access to your account, we suggest that you change your Grammarly password. Changing your password will log out all devices that might be connected to your account.

You can change your password at https://app.grammarly.com/profile/account. Make sure you set a complex new password that you don't use on any other websites.

Additionally, if you have used your Grammarly password for any other websites, we strongly recommend changing your password on those sites as well.

Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad to hear that you are interested in using Grammarly. 

The Ownership section of the Terms of Service should address your concern. It states “All intellectual property rights in and to the User Content are and shall remain your property, and Grammarly shall acquire no right of ownership with respect to your User Content.” 

Here’s what that means:

By using Grammarly, you are giving us the right to use your content in connection with providing our services. In other words, you’re giving us formal permission to provide writing suggestions and corrections to you and to use your writing to improve our algorithms. You remain the owner of your content.

For example, if you write a novel while using Grammarly, the copyright remains under your control. That means that only you have the right to sell, publish, or distribute your novel.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly! I'm happy to assist you today.

I understand that you would like to receive a list of all emails and names linked to the credit card number you've provided.

As Grammarly takes the privacy of our users very seriously, we can partially provide the names of users linked to your payment method.

I need some additional information from you to confirm that you are the owner of the payment method that was used:

- last four digits of the credit card number that was used for Grammarly, 
- card network type (e.g., VISA) 
- credit card expiration date (month/year) 
- charge amount 
- the exact date of the payment

First of all, thank you for your message! I'm happy to assist you today.

To proceed with your request, I need some additional verification information from you:

- the reference number on your statement, if you see one (it should look similar to CO5DXT-8GCH, CO*5DXT-8GCH, 5DXT-8GCH, or qWe23zA)

OR

- the email address associated with the account
- the name on the account
- last four digits of the credit card number that was used to pay for Grammarly 
- card network type (e.g., VISA) 
- credit card expiration date (month/year) 
- charge amount 
- the exact date of the payment 
- If you are seeing “PAYPAL” next to the charge on your credit card statement, we will need to know your PayPal email and Transaction ID.

Once the account is verified, we'll go ahead and cancel the subscription. If you do not have these details, we recommend that the account owner contacts us directly regarding the cancelation. I know this is a hassle, but this security procedure allows us to protect user information.

Thanks for contacting Grammarly Customer Support! We are sorry that you're having difficulties confirming your email address.

If the confirmation / verification email wasn't delivered to your email address {{ticket.requester.email}}, please try following these steps:

1. Check your Spam and Promotions folders (as well as any email filters you've set up) to make sure the message isn't being directed away from your email inbox. 
2. If you cannot find the email after checking your Spam folder and any other tabs in your inbox, try adding info@em.grammarly.com to your contact list. Afterward, we recommend updating the email again / requesting a verification email again. 

If none of these steps help, it must be your firewall/email server or filter that is blocking Grammarly's emails. We recommend contacting your email service provider's Customer Support to whitelist the following IPs and email to ensure that all Grammarly emails get through:

2. If you cannot find the password reset email after checking your spam folder, try adding info@send.grammarly.com, info@em.grammarly.com, and donotreply@grammarly.com to your contact list. Afterward, we recommend sending yourself a password reset email again.

I hope this helps!

Thank you for contacting Grammarly! Let me check this for you.

At this time, Grammarly does not offer lifetime or one-time plans. As your account {{ticket.requester.email}} doesn't have any billing history on file, this leads us to believe that you may have purchased a Grammarly plan from a fraudulent third-party that advertised it as a lifetime offer.

You can be sure that your Grammarly Premium subscription is authentic by upgrading your account at grammarly.com or through our affiliate partners. If you’re not sure whether a certain website is our affiliate, please double-check this with us before purchasing any offers on Grammarly Premium from them to avoid experiencing this issue in the future.

I hope this clarifies the matter, but feel free to reach out with any further questions or comments.

Thank you for getting in touch! I'm happy to assist you today.

According to our analysis, the most recent emails sent to {{ticket.requester.email}} from Grammarly got bounced. This can happen because an inbox was deemed as full or an auto-responder or vacation reply has been activated for a while, or a sender's email was blocked by the receiving server.

To resolve the issue, we suggest you search your inbox/spam folder for any previous emails from Grammarly, open one of them, and click any link in the email. You will also need to add the following email addresses to your contact list:

info@em.grammarly.com
info@send.grammarly.com
donotreply@grammarly.com

After that, send yourself a password reset email by going to https://www.grammarly.com/resetpassword. The email should arrive within about a minute and contain a link that will bring you to a page where you'll be asked to create a new password.

I hope this helps! Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.

For security considerations, we are not authorized to reset passwords without verifying the account holder identity first. Unfortunately, since you are using a free version of Grammarly, we have no viable means of verifying the account.

You can create a new free account at www.grammarly.com/signup using a different email address. I know this is a hassle, but this security procedure is necessary for us to protect users’ accounts from unauthorized access.

I understand that a password reset email cannot be delivered because you don't have access to your email account. Grammarly requires that you have access to this email address to reset your account password. 

We recommend that you try contacting your email service provider (ESP) to regain access to your email account. Only your ESP has the ability and authorization to help you regain access to your email address. Grammarly is not an ESP, and we cannot contact ESPs on your behalf.

We offer the Grammarly Editor, the Grammarly browser extension, Grammarly’s native app, Grammarly for Microsoft Office, as well as the Grammarly Keyboard for Android and iOS free of charge.

​Thanks for contacting Grammarly Customer Support! I see that you have some confusion about our rates and the amount shown on your account statement; let me clarify this for you.

Currently, we offer the following rates https://grammarly.com/premium/:

Monthly Subscription — $29.95 USD/month 
Quarterly Subscription — $59.95 USD/three months (billed as one payment) 
Annual Subscription — $139.95 USD/one year (billed as one payment)

To ensure that our users are aware of the cost savings of an annual subscription, we also list prices by the average cost per month, although plans of more than one month are billed as one charge. Please see our billing policy for details at http://www.grammarly.com/terms#billing
