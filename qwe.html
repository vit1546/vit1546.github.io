If you post or transfer any information to or through our Products, you are confirming your consent to such information, including Personal Information and User Content, being hosted and accessed in the United States.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from those in the United States, but Grammarly complies with applicable law regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Information collected from all our users.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">How Secure Is My Data?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">Grammarly is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of information you transmit to us, including Personal Information and User Content; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">We use industry standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of administrative, physical and logical security safeguards. The security of the information stored locally in any of our Products installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use with our applications and service.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">If Grammarly learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">IV. INFORMATION DELETION<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h3><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">What Happens If I Want to Stop Using Grammarly?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">You can stop using our Products at any time. Residual copies of your Personal Information and deleted User Content may continue to exist on Grammarly’s back-up and archiving systems for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">What Happens If Grammarly Closes My Account?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">If Grammarly closes your account due to your violation of the Terms of Service, then you may contact Grammarly to request deletion of your data, and Grammarly will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">V.

Anyone can submit a question and have it answered by the Grammarly community.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-black70\"><strong>Reputation and Degree System<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">Grammarly Answers's Reputation and Degree System is a user-ranking system aimed at encouraging high-quality participation on the site. This system is designed to make it easier for members of the community to identify high-quality contributors and to become recognized participants on the forum. We’ve broken this into two parts: reputation points and degree ranking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70 wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Reputation Points<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">All participants on Grammarly Answers will start with 1 reputation point (rep point). Additional rep points will be awarded for contributions to the site. High-quality contributions, as determined by the community, will be awarded more points, while low-quality contributions will receive less or even remove rep points from a user’s account. Below are the point values awarded for various actions on the forum:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">Every user starts with 1 rep point.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">When a user’s question is upvoted, the user receives +5 rep points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">When a user's question is downvoted, the user receives -2 rep points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">When a user’s answer is upvoted, the user receives +10 rep points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">When a user’s answer is downvoted, the user receives -10 rep points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">If a user’s answer selected as best answer, the user receives +15 rep points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">When a user selects a best answer for his or her question, the user receives +2 rep points (only if the user does not select his or her own answer).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When users cancel actions on the forum, the points awarded for those actions are removed. For example, if a user selects answer #100 as the best answer, the user will receive +2 rep points and the answer's author will receive +15 rep points. But if the user then cancels the selection of best answer, the user will receive -2 rep points and the answer's author will receive -15 rep points. Reputation points will never go below 1.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70 wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Degree Ranking<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">The degree rankings are classified according to the number of reputation points a user has earned. There are four different degrees with differing incentives at each level: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\"><strong>New Member<\/strong>: 1 - 99 rep points <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\">This is a newly registered Grammarly Answers user.<\/span><br /><br /><strong>Contributor<\/strong>: 100 - 999 rep points<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expert<\/strong>: 1,000 - 9,999 rep points<\/p>\n<p>These are active community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grammarly Fellow<\/strong>: 10,000+ rep points<\/p>\n<p>Fellows are active long-term members.

Below is a list that details the variations among the styles, from most to least formal:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">Academic<\/span><br />Academic is Grammarly’s strictest style. On top of finding grammar and punctuation mistakes, it detects passive voice, contractions, informal pronouns (I, you), and locates unclear antecedents (e.g., sentences starting with “This is…”).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">Business<\/span><br />The business style also checks the text against formal writing criteria. However, it allows use of some informal expressions, informal pronouns, and unclear antecedents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">General<\/span><br />This is the default style and uses a medium level of strictness.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">Technical<\/span><br />The purpose of this style is to avoid ambiguities in technical writing. It detects missing serial commas, the use of future tense, subjunctive mood, and abbreviations or expressions like “etc.” and “and/or.”<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">Casual<\/span><br />Casual is designed for informal types of writing and ignores most style issues. It does not flag contractions, passives, informal pronouns, who-vs-whom usage, split infinitives, or run-on sentences. This style is suitable for personal communication.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-cyan120\">Creative<\/span><br />This is the most permissive style. It catches grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes but allows some leeway for those who want to intentionally bend grammar rules to achieve certain effects. Creative doesn’t flag sentence fragments (missing subjects or verbs), wordy sentences, colloquialisms, informal pronouns, passives, incomplete comparisons, or run-on sentences.<\/p>",

Your network or system administrator is a person or a provider who administers your local network, your ISP, and your computer settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does Grammarly need in order to function correctly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Besides HTTPS requests, Grammarly products use WebSockets to communicate with the text checking service. The WebSockets use HTTP and HTTPS, with the corresponding ports of 80 and 443. You can read more about WebSockets here:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket\">wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.websocket.org/aboutwebsocket.html\" target=\"_blank\">websocket.org<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: We have ports 80 and 443 opened for any connections, but Grammarly still encounters issues with WebSockets. What do we do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: In order to work with your firewall correctly, WebSockets needs not only for these ports to be \"opened\" but also for there to be some support on the firewall/proxy level.<\/p>\n<p>After establishing a connection, a browser issues an HTTP request with an Upgrade header, which is a hop-by-hop header (i.e., it is meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and it is neither stored by caches nor forwarded by proxies by default). If a proxy/firewall is not aware of WebSockets and it doesn't forward it further (making some other effort alongside, e.g., keeping the connection active), then it is impossible to establish a connection.<\/p>\n<p>Please consult your proxy/firewall documentation about how to enable support for WebSockets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: We have protocol/domain/URL-based firewall rules, what should we allow for Grammarly to work properly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A:  Besides our HTTPS services (*.grammarly.com, *.grammarly.io) for WebSockets, we use the following endpoints:<\/p>\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/fpws <\/p>\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/freews<\/p>\n<p>wss://dox.grammarly.com/documents<\/p>\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/wstest<\/p>",

Your network or system administrator is a person or a provider who administers your local network, your ISP, or your computer settings.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does Grammarly need in order to function correctly?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Besides HTTPS requests, Grammarly products use WebSockets to communicate with the text checking service. The WebSockets use HTTP and HTTPS, with the corresponding ports of <strong>80<\/strong> and <strong>443<\/strong>. You can read more about Websockets here: <\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.websocket.org/aboutwebsocket.html\">https://www.websocket.org/aboutwebsocket.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: We have ports 80 and 443 opened for any connections, but Grammarly encounters issues with WebSockets. What do we do?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: In order to work with your firewall correctly, WebSockets not only need these ports to be \"opened\", but there should also be some support on the firewall/proxy level.<\/p>\r\n<p>After establishing a connection, a browser issues an HTTP request with an Upgrade header, which is a hop-by-hop header, i.e. it is meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and it is neither stored by caches nor forwarded by proxies by default. If a proxy/firewall is not aware of WebSockets and it doesn't forward it further (making some other effort alongside, e.g. keeping the connection active), then it is impossible to establish a connection. <\/p>\r\n<p>Please consult your proxy/firewall documentation about how to enable support for WebSockets.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: We have protocol/domain/URL based firewall rules, what should we allow for Grammarly to work properly?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Besides our HTTPS services (*.grammarly.com, *.grammarly.io) for WebSockets, we use the following endpoints:<\/p>\r\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/fpws <\/p>\r\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/freews<\/p>\r\n<p>wss://dox.grammarly.com/documents<\/p>\r\n<p>wss://capi.grammarly.com/wstest<\/p>",
