It gets me where I need to go, but I’m tired of fixing leaks and broken parts all the time. Its annoying that I have to take it to mechanic every times. Even when they take care of everything, I know in a week I’ll just end up going back there.\\n\\nI have finally decided that I am not going to do it anymore. I have decided to buy a new car! Unfortunately, I have a problem. I have no idea what car to get. Do I want something fast? Do I want something big? Do I want something stylish? Something economical? I have so many choices that I don’t even know where to begin. I am not sure if I will be able to make the decision on my own. I don't have a lot of money either, so I probably don't have many option.\\n\\nAfter I did some research, I knew that I would need some expert advice. Eventually, I went to a local dealership to check out some new models. I talked to the saleswoman and listened at she carefully. Her honesty and professionalism were really impressive. She had a lot of vary helpful suggestions and showed myself some safe affordable choices. After a long discussion I finally decided which one I wanted. She not only helped me with the paperwork and finished the sale, but also the insurance. I was expecting this purchase to be a serious hassle, but the experience was almost painless. Everything went smoothly, and now I have a brand new car!\\n\\nI was so excited when I pulled out of the lot that the first thing I did was change lanes right in front of other car. “That wasn't very nice,” I thought to myself. I needed to relax. I didn’t realize what a serious mistake I had made however. I hadn’t just cut off any other car, I had cut off a police car! It took a few seconds to realize what was happening when I saw the flashing lights in my rearview mirror. By the time I had managed to pull over, my heart was racing. I gathered all the paperwork as he approached my window.\\n\\n“You forgot to signal back there” said Officer Johnson, according to his nametag.\\n\\n“Yes, well, it’s a new car so I guess I was a bit unfamiliar with the controls,” I stammered.\\n\\nHe looked at me skeptically.\\n\\n“I’m pretty sure the controls for the turn signal are in the same place on every car.”\\n\\nWhat could I say? He was right.\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” I ventured.\\n\\nHe looked over my paper work and noticed that the car was new.\\n\\n“It would be unfortunate to get a ticket on your first day in a new vehicle,” he said, smiling. “Try not to cut in front of anyone on your way home.”\\n\\nI had never felt so relieved in my life.\\n\\n“Thank you, officer!”\\n\\nAs he made his way back to his car I let out a huge sigh. I took a few seconds to compose myself before shifting into gear and driving away from the side of the rode. Now I have a brand new car and a story to tell!\\n\"\n}\n      })\n      require('/js/loggers')\n      swf_url = 'https://d3269ducu6cd4y.cloudfront.net/static/24f9c7f40b/zero_clipboard.swf'\n      var app = require('/js/app')\n      $(app.run)\n    </script>\n    <editor:offline-overlay></editor:offline-overlay>\n    </body>\n</html>\n
