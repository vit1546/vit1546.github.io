	History
	
	The company was founded in 2009 by Alex Shevchenko and Max Lytvyn. Brad Hoover, the company's chief executive officer, is an investor with a background in engineering who learned about Grammarly while searching for an automated proofreading tool for his own writing.
	
	Grammarly, Inc., is headquartered in San Francisco, with an additional office in Kiev, Ukraine.
	Features
	
	Grammarly carries out more than 250 grammar checks; it proofreads and detects plagiarism in the process and finally provides users with a list of possible errors for correction.
	
	During its text review, Grammarly presents potential errors one at a time, with commonly confused words or faulty sentences highlighted in light red and a text box below offering an explanation that provides good and bad examples and suggests corrections. Grammarly also provides citations when it detects plagiarism. Users can click on a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" icon to let Grammarly know whether the result was helpful.
	
	
	Other features of Grammarly include:
	
	
		A grammar checker that can analyze general, business, academic, technical, creative and casual writings.
		A contextual spell checker that determines the appropriate spelling of a word as it is used in a sentence; thus, it finds misspelled words and also identifies correctly spelled yet incorrectly used words.
		Grammarly Plug-in for Microsoft Office, which adds Grammarly to Microsoft Word and Outlook.
		An online Grammarly Handbook resource covering what the Grammarly platform does in checking grammar and syntax.
		Firefox and Google Chrome extensions, which spell check and grammar check as you type online.
